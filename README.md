### 👋 Hello and welcome！❤️  
🎓 I’m Yumi Jin. I’m currently wrapping up my master’s degree at UC Davis with a major in __Business Analytics__.   
Before this, I earned my bachelor’s degree in __Big Data Applications__ in China.   
I have around three years of professional experience in data science where I developed strong skills in machine learning algorithms and database management.  
Recently, I’ve been working as a __Data Scientist__ for a health product company in San Francisco, focusing on sentiment analysis and predictive modeling.  

🌱 I’m interested in __Machine learning__, __Natural Language Processing__, __Web-Scraping__, __Visualizations__ and __SQL__.  
So basically most of my projects are topics related to them.  
Also most are based on __Python__ language.  

> 😄 I am actively seeking opportunities that will allow me to contribute to, and grow with, a team that values innovation and data-driven decision-making.  
  
📫 Whether you're looking for a dedicated data analyst or someone to share insights on the latest in business analytics, I'm eager to connect and explore how we can drive success together! So, please feel free to reach out to me at yumjin@ucdavis.edu for any professional inquiries or opportunities where my passion and skills can make a difference!!
