### 👋 Hello and welcome！❤️  
🎓 I’m Yumi Jin, an aspiring MSBA candidate at UC Davis, with an anticipated graduation in June 2024.   
My journey began with an undergraduate major in Big Data, laying a solid foundation for my passion for data analytics.  
Since then, I have gained valuable real-world experience through internships, amounting to approximately two year, where I honed my skills as a data analyst.  

🌱 I’m interested in __Machine learning__, __Natural Language Processing__, __Web-Scraping__, __Visualizations__ and __SQL__.  
So basically most of my projects are topics related to them.  
Also most are based on __Python__ language.  

💞️ What sets me apart is not just my proficiency in technical skills but also the values that drive my professional journey:
- _Technical Mastery:_ I am adept in leveraging Python for web scraping and machine learning, creating impactful data visualizations with Tableau, and managing database technologies using SQL. These skills have empowered me to deliver insights that drive strategic decisions.  

- _Professional Values:_ My work is guided by a trio of core values—perseverance, passion, and growth. These principles not only propel me forward but also shape my approach to challenges and learning opportunities.

- _Project Highlights:_ My practical experience includes optimizing market growth strategies for MenoWell Menopause Energy + Protein Bars, where I utilized Python and Tableau to analyze customer feedback and sales data, driving actionable insights.


> 😄 I am actively seeking opportunities that will allow me to contribute to, and grow with, a team that values innovation and data-driven decision-making.
